# XBUS-503-01.Data_Ingestion_and_Wrangling

## Course Details
Cleaning and formatting data, also known as “data wrangling,” are the most under appreciated yet time-consuming steps in the data science pipeline. In real world analyses, data wrangling can consume up to 80% of project time.  During this course, students will learn and apply the Extract/ Transform/ Load (ETL) process used by professional data scientists to clean and prep data sets for analysis.

##Course Objectives
Upon successful completion of the course, students will:

* Understand the time commitment needed for data wrangling 
* Identify data sets that may be time-intensive to clean
* Efficiently clean data sets of both structured and unstructured data to prepare for analysis
* Apply the Extract/ Transform/ Load (ETL) process to a data set
* Better estimate the time required for data wrangling tasks

## Notes
Enrollment in this course is restricted. Students must submit an application and be accepted into the [Certificate in Data Science](http://scs.georgetown.edu/programs_nc/CE0124/data-analytics) in order to register for this course.

Current Georgetown students must create an application using their Georgetown NetID and password. New students will be prompted to create an account.
