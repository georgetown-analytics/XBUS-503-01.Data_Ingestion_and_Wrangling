# Overview

This repository contains demonstration code for the XBUS-503 Data Wrangling course at Georgetown University CCPE. The code should be run in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which allows one to interactively run Python code within a web browser.

## BeautifulSoup

This notebook demonstrates the ease with which one can use [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to efficiently navigate and parse HTML.  

## Pandas

The [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) library is one of the most preferred tools for data manipulation and analysis. In this notebook, we'll use pandas to quickly explore and analyze the [MovieLens](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) database.

# Setup

To install the required libraries, use pip install and the provided requirements.txt file.

	pip install -r requirements.txt

# Use / Run

To start the Jupyter Notebook from the command line, use the following command:

	jupyter notebook
